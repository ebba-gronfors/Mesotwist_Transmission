Matlab code made to calculate transmission of light through mesotwisted cell structures in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (LC). 
Compare two wavelengths and six structures with varying shape and/or cell gap. 
The simulation is based on Jones Calculus. The bulk of the LC is split into 1000 equally thick slabs, and within each slab the director is approximated to be uniform.
